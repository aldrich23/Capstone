    "Covid-19 has negatively affected tourism in Japan as with everywhere else, and a return to pre-Covid days is unlikely, or slow at best. In the latter scenario, future travellers are probably limited in the areas they could explore, and it would be best if they could have an efficient travel plan where they are able to enjoy the most number of experiences in the shortest period of time. One strategy would be to visit areas with a high concentration of attractions, food places, and entertainment where it is easy to navigate by foot and the venues are close to each other."
